# autoresearch_sr

This is an experiment to have the LLM autonomously improve symbolic regression.

## Setup

To set up a new experiment, work with the user to:

1. **Agree on a run tag**: propose a tag based on today's date (e.g. `apr7`). The branch `autoresearch/<tag>` must not already exist — this is a fresh run.
2. **Create the branch**: `git checkout -b autoresearch/<tag>` from current main.
3. **Read the in-scope files**: Read these files for full context:
   - `program.md` — these instructions.
   - `prepare.py` — fixed evaluation harness. Do not modify.
{MODE_SETUP_SECTION}
4. **Initialize results.tsv**: Create `results.tsv` with just the header row. The baseline will be recorded after the first run.
5. **Confirm and go**: Confirm setup looks good.

Once you get confirmation, kick off the experimentation.

## Experimentation

Each experiment evaluates symbolic regression performance on SRBench benchmarks via SLURM. The evaluation runs for several minutes — be patient.

{MODE_RULES_SECTION}

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Modify `prepare.py`. It is read-only. It contains the fixed evaluation harness.
- Modify `program.md`. These instructions are fixed.
{MODE_CONSTRAINTS_SECTION}

**The goal is simple: get the highest score.** The metric is `{METRIC}` ({METRIC_DESCRIPTION}). Current baseline (unmodified PySR): **{BASELINE_SCORE}**.

**Simplicity criterion**: All else being equal, simpler is better. A small improvement that adds ugly complexity is not worth it. Removing something and getting equal or better results is a great outcome.

**The first run**: Your very first run should always be to establish the baseline:
```
python prepare.py --mode baseline {PREPARE_FLAGS} > run.log 2>&1
```

## Output format

Once the evaluation finishes it prints a summary like this:

```
---
score:    0.423000
datasets: 12
metric:   gt
n_runs:   3
---
```

You can extract the key metric from the log file:
```
grep "^score:" run.log
```

## Logging results

When an experiment is done, log it to `results.tsv` (tab-separated, NOT comma-separated).

The TSV has a header row and 4 columns:

```
commit	score	status	description
```

1. git commit hash (short, 7 chars)
2. score achieved (e.g. 0.423000) — use 0.000000 for crashes
3. status: `keep`, `discard`, or `crash`
4. short text description of what this experiment tried

Example:

```
commit	score	status	description
a1b2c3d	0.423000	keep	baseline
b2c3d4e	0.445000	keep	add complexity-aware survival operator
c3d4e5f	0.410000	discard	aggressive tree pruning mutation (too destructive)
d4e5f6g	0.000000	crash	invalid Julia syntax in selection operator
```

## The experiment loop

The experiment runs on a dedicated branch (e.g. `autoresearch/apr7`).

LOOP FOREVER:

1. Look at the git state: the current branch/commit we're on
2. {MODE_EDIT_INSTRUCTION}
3. git commit
4. Run the experiment: `python prepare.py --mode {MODE} {PREPARE_FLAGS} > run.log 2>&1` (redirect everything — do NOT use tee or let output flood your context)
5. Read out the results: `grep "^score:" run.log`
6. If the grep output is empty, the run crashed. Run `tail -n 50 run.log` to read the error and attempt a fix. If you can't get things to work after more than a few attempts, give up on this direction.
7. Record the results in the tsv (NOTE: do not commit the results.tsv file, leave it untracked by git)
8. If score improved (higher), you "advance" the branch, keeping the git commit
9. If score is equal or worse, you git reset back to where you started

The idea is that you are a completely autonomous researcher trying things out. If they work, keep. If they don't, discard. And you're advancing the branch so that you can iterate.

**Crashes**: If a run crashes (Julia error, SLURM failure, syntax error), use your judgment: If it's something dumb and easy to fix (e.g. a typo, wrong function signature), fix it and re-run. If the idea itself is fundamentally broken, just skip it, log "crash" as the status in the tsv, and move on.

**NEVER STOP**: Once the experiment loop has begun (after the initial setup), do NOT pause to ask the human if you should continue. Do NOT ask "should I keep going?" or "is this a good stopping point?". The human might be asleep, or gone from a computer and expects you to continue working *indefinitely* until you are manually stopped. You are autonomous. If you run out of ideas, think harder — re-read the reference docs, try combining previous near-misses, try more radical changes. The loop runs until the human interrupts you, period.

As an example use case, a user might leave you running while they sleep. If each experiment takes ~5 minutes then you can run approx 12/hour. The user then wakes up to experimental results, all completed by you while they slept!
